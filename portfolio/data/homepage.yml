  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    My journey began with high school Computer Science courses, where I learned the 
    fundamentals of object-oriented programming with Java and Python. Subsequently, 
    I decided to pursue a degree at Michigan State University. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    During my years at MSU, I had the privilege of working with brilliant students 
    and engineers on several projects, both in and outside the classroom. In my 
    sophomore year, I participated in the 2021 SAE AutoDrive Challenge, contributing 
    to the development of HD map parsing and path planning functionality for our 
    autonomous vehicle. In the Summer of 2022, as a Software Engineer Intern at Amazon, 
    I developed functionality for the Alexa mobile app, enhancing the user experience 
    of its collaborative shopping list feature. For more details regarding my work 
    experience, please refer to the section below.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Since my graduation in May 2023, I have been co-developing a multiplayer, 
    action-style video game called Grapple Tanks. My partner and I released an early 
    access version of the game on the Steam distribution platform in January 2024 and 
    continue to expand its features and content.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, working out, and reading.
