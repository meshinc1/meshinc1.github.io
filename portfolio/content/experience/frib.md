### Student Technical Assistant at FRIB

***

##### Brief

The [Facility for Rare Isotope Beams](https://frib.msu.edu/) is a scientific user facility for nuclear science at Michigan State University. In my role as a Student Technical Assistant, I worked with the mechanical design team to troubleshoot technical issues and automate design processes where necesssary.

##### Responsibilities

- Collaborated with engineers to diagnose and resolve integration issues between CAD and PDM software by
replicating reported problems and testing potential solutions.
- Devised automation scripts using Windows Forms applications (VB.NET) to streamline the expansion process of
the in-house fastener library, resulting in the efficient generation of 1000s of fastener parts.
