### Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon

***

##### Brief

My internship at Amazon served as my first professional experience in software development. The role provided me insights into effective communication with my manager, the importance of understanding systems on a macroscopic level, and the intricacies of software design.

##### Responsibilities

- Developed a feature for the Alexa mobile app by modifying UI elements and existing APIs to improve the
customer experience.
- Coordinated with team members and other developers during implementation and leveraged the collective
knowledge to revise project-related changes during code reviews.
- Wrote 15+ unit tests using a mock framework and conducted further functionality verification using integration
tests and internal APIs.
- Created documentation on the high-level operation of the feature, and a guide on testing-environment setup
necessary for any future related work.
