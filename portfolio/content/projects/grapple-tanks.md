# Grapple Tanks: Multiplayer Action Game :video_game:

***

### Introduction

Grapple Tanks is a 2D, online multiplayer fighter game playable with up to 4 people. Players manuever a grappling-hook-equipped tank in an endless deathmatch, where the last tank standing earns a point. Players have the option to play with friends, or join public lobbies with random players.

My partner [Dorian Florescu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florescu-dorian/) and I began toying with ideas for a game in our college apartment back in December 2021. It wasn't until mid-2023, however, that we committed to completing and publishing a playable video game.

Our goal with Grapple Tanks was to create a casual yet fast-paced and humerous game, with unique mechanics and extensive content for an engaging experience. Inspired by similar titles such as *Stick Fight: The Game*, we aimed to make the game intuitive to learn while still including some challenging aspects.

The first milestone was developing a functional prototype of a multiplayer fighter game, with basic movement and combat mechanics. In early October 2023, with the game nearing a playable state, we formed an LLC, FlorMesh Games, enabling us to publish the game on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2679340/Grapple_Tanks/).

Steam is a video game digital distribution service and storefront with 132 million monthly active users. The platform provides an intuitive solution for indie game developers seeking to publish their game and reach a global audience.

In January 2024, we released Grapple Tanks as an early access (beta) title on Steam to begin building a community and gathering feedback from players, while continuing to expand the game's content. The current available version of the game has the following features:

- **2-4 player** online multiplayer
- **10 levels**
- **Physics-based** grappling and combat
- **Dynamic terrain:** players can break through certain walls, floors, and ceilings
- **Weapons:** a variety of weapons made available through randomized supply drops
- **Powerups:** grant abilities including increased strength, agility, and damage protection
