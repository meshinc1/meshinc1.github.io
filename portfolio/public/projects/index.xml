      <description>Grapple Tanks: Multiplayer Action Game &amp;#x1f3ae; Introduction Grapple Tanks is a 2D, online multiplayer fighter game playable with up to 4 people. Players manuever a grappling-hook-equipped tank in an endless deathmatch, where the last tank standing earns a point. Players have the option to play with friends, or join public lobbies with random players.&#xA;My partner Dorian Florescu and I began toying with ideas for a game in our college apartment back in December 2021.</description>
